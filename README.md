Gesture recognition is the process of identifying human hand gestures or movements and interpreting them as commands or actions
for a computer system. In computer vision, gesture recognition has various applications such as virtual reality, gaming, sign language 
recognition, and human-robot interaction. The system uses a camera or a sensor to capture the hand movements and then applies computer vision 
algorithms to detect and recognize gestures. The machine learning models are trained on large datasets of annotated hand gestures to improve
accuracy and performance. Gesture recognition systems are an important area of research in computer vision and have the potential to 
revolutionize the way we interact with technology. A project on gesture recognition can involve building a real-time system that can
recognize a set of predefined hand gestures and trigger corresponding actions.
As an example, we will take (hello, thumbs up, thumbs down, and Thanks)
